### What to do with this release?

This release can be used to develop BizTalk solutions using a consistent solution structure.
It is very difficult to test every part of the BizTalk Software Factory, so if you find anything that isn't right, could be better or just isn't functioning then please let me know.
Also if you have great ideas please tell me and I'll try to implement them.
This release consists of the source code and some basic documentation.
Have fun!

### Future Plans

The current version will be improved and extended with new functionality

### History

This release is based on the project Dick Dijkstra started a few years ago on CodePlex (BASF).
Dick did a great job starting the project and figuring out some of the hard to learn basics.
